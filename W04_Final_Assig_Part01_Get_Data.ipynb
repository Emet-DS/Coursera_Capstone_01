    "- He understands that it's a very competitive market, and also has limited monetary resources to setup the restaurant.\n",
    "- There are some specific questions that he asked me to answer:\n",
    " - What **type of restaurant** would be a good bet for San Diego.  \n",
    " - What **general location** would provide reasonable success for that specific type of restaurant, considering there is less competition for that type of restaurant.\n"

    "- A general ranking of restaurant types for the **San Diego** area would provide a good starting point, and confirm **Joes** preference for **one type** of restaurant (eg. Fast Food, Italian, etc.).\n",
    "- Since we need to find a location that would provide reasonable success, we would require to review restaurant popularity by geographic locations (Neighborhoods? Zipcodes?)\n",
    "- Once we find locations with very popular restaurants, we will identify if those locations have similar geographic/demographic attributes.\n",

    "    - A specific reference of geographic sites is defined, to analyze the zones **\"profile\"\"**.\n",
    " - Save the general geographic data, for further analysis (find ideal sites that have less competition).\n",

    "    - Number of people for the geographic zone, number of businesses, total area, and other demographic attributes that can help us.\n",
